                    stitching and make unique and useful art together. Maybe you, too, have soft memories of these kinds
                    of get-together, grandparents or parents bickering, joking, and chuckling over potlucks or bake
                    sales or craft fairs. Itâ€™s soothing to make something special and share it with your people.

                    Sometimes people ask what poetry is <i>good for.</i> Poetry for a writer can be an art, a spiritual
                    practice, a brain puzzle, and a way to seek truth in yourself and in the world around you. We also
                    use poems when we need to put words in a room between us, to connect us over one emotion: new love,
                    weddings, funerals, and even political upheaval. Poetry is there when we want to find unity.

                    Bee Balm is also a flower that belongs to Arkansas, drawing bees and butterflies to its fluffy
                    firework blossoms.
