          <p>
            Quilting bees in the mid-19th century were ways that folks could
            show off their fancy stitching and make unique and useful art
            together. Maybe you, too, have soft memories of these kinds of
            get-together, grandparents or parents bickering, joking, and
            chuckling over potlucks or bake sales or craft fairs. Itâ€™s soothing
            to make something special and share it with your people.

          <p>
            Sometimes people ask what poetry is good for. Poetry for a writer
            can be an art, a spiritual practice, a brain puzzle, and a way to
            seek truth in yourself and in the world around you. We also use
            poems when we need to put words in a room between us, to connect us
            over one emotion: new love, weddings, funerals, and even political
            upheaval. Poetry is there when we want to find unity.
