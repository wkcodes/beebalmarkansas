            Sometimes people ask what poetry is good for.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Poetry for a writer can be an art, a spiritual practice, a brain
            puzzle, and a way to seek truth in yourself and in the world around
            you. We also use poems when we need to put words in a room between
            us, to connect us over one emotion: new love, weddings, funerals,
            and even political upheaval. Poetry is there when we want to find
            unity.
