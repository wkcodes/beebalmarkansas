      <p class="mx-96 my-8">In the mid-19th century, quilting bees and barn raisings were ways to bring people together
        and
        get the hard
        things done. Stitching and sweating with friends and neighbors drew folks closer together.

        Maybe you remember this too--the bake sales and church bazaars your nana brought you to as a child. Maybe you
        too played Miss Mary Mack and hopscotch in the parking lot while the grown-ups proudly shared their wares and
        begged for Susan's Hershey pie recipe. (Susan never did share it.)

        And in some ways, a bee is a solitary creature. Before she returns to the hive to dance directions to the other
        bees, before she with her sisters fans the nectar thick, before honey fills the careful cavities of the hive
        with its gold shimmer, a bee ventures out alone on the wind to collect pollen on her legs and face, to find
        flowers worth her while.

        And isn't being together what soothes us, our weathered hearts, our hands? We too go out trying to find life's
        sweetness. Isn't it good to come together and share what we've made? </p>
